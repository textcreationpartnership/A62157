    _ Q. 3. Whether the Holy Three, the FATHER, SON, and



HOLY GHOST, that bear record in Heaven, be not threediſtinct Perſons of one Subſtance, Power, Glory and Eternity? Or are they only three manifeſtations, or operations, and is there not ſome Incommunicable, as well as Communicable Attributes, belonging to the Perſons of the Holy Trinity?

    _ Q. 4. Is not the promiſed Seed of the Woman, that ſhould

    _ Q 5. That ſeed of Abraham to which the Promiſe was made, that in him all the Nations of the Earth ſhall be bleſſed, according to Gen. 22. 18. Gal. 3. 16 Was it not the Man CHRIST JESUS who according to the Fleſh, was the Son of Abraham, and the Son of David, Matt. 1. 1.

    _ Q. 6 Had not this Man, a real Soul, that was not the Godhead, and a real Body alſo, that was not the God-head?

    _ Q 7 Is not that outward Man who was born of the Virgin, and ſuffered without the Gates of Jeruſalem, properly and truly the SON of GOD, having no immediat FATHER but GOD.

    _ Q. 8. Is not JESUS CHRIST, both GOD and Man, and yet but one CHRIST, ſo that his Godhead is not his Manhood, though the Nature of his Manhood, is moſt highly, and wonderfully united to his Godhead?

    _ Q. 9. Did CHRIST's Natural Body, which was Crucified and was Buried, riſe again? And did that Body after his Reſurrection, aſcend into Heaven? And is that Body now in Heaven?

    _ Q. 10 Is that Heaven, into which CHRIST hath aſcended, in the true Glorified Nature of Man conſiſting of Soul and Body) without us, or within us only? And do you own the Man CHRIST JESUS to be without you, as well as His ſpirit and Light within you?

    _ Q. 12. Is it altogether, and wholy, as neceſſary for us to believe in CHRIST without us, for our Eternal Salvation, as to believe in his Spiritual Light within us? and is not the Faith in the Man CHRIST, as he dyed for our Sins, and roſe again, and is at the Right Hand of GOD, and maketh interceſſion for us, according to Rom. 8. 34. neceſſary to be Preached frequently, as well as his inward appearance, by every true Miniſter of CHRIST?

    _ Q 16. Do the beſt works, that any are enabled to perform, even by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit; merit pardon of ſin and eternal Life?

    _ Q 17. Shall the Man CHRIST JESUS come again and appear without us to judge the Quick and the Dead?

    _ Q. 18. Is there any Reſurrection of the Dead, that all or any of the Deceaſed Saints wait for? and doth the ſame Natural Body, that Dyeth riſe again, or is the Reſurrection nothing elſe, but what ye have already or what ye ſhall have, immediatly after Death?
